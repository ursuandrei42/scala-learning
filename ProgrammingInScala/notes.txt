Ch6 Functional Objects
Rational numbers do not have mutable state. You can add one rational number to
another, but the result will be a new rational number. The original numbers will not have “changed.” The immutable Rational class we’ll design
in this chapter will have the same property.

class Rational(n: Int, d: Int)
The identifiers n and d in the parentheses after the class name, Rational, are called class parameters.
This initial Rational example highlights a difference between Java and
Scala. In Java, classes have constructors, which can take parameters,
whereas in Scala, classes can take parameters directly.

In Scala, constructors other than the primary constructor are called auxiliary constructors.
In Scala, every auxiliary constructor must invoke another constructor of
the same class as its first action.

An initializer is the code that initializes a variable

Ch7 Build-in control structures
The while and do-while constructs are called “loops,” not expressions,
because they don’t result in an interesting value. The type of the result is
Unit.
